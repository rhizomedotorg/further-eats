				<p>About</p>

				<p>This exhibition showcases new works created artists Andrew Demirjian, Foreign Objects, Kinlaw, Fei Liu, Mark Ramos & Ziyang Wu, and Sarah Rothberg as part of a unique collaboration between NEW INC, Rhizome, and the Experiments in Art & Technology program at Nokia Bell Labs. </p>

				<p>Last year, Rhizome and NEW INC welcomed a cohort of artists and designers to the cultural incubator for a special year-long opportunity to pursue interdisciplinary practices in conversation and, ultimately, collaboration with the research community at Nokia Bell Labs. Artists were selected for their innovative use of digital tools and practices through a variety of forms including movement and performance, creative coding and design, and their alignment with the research subjects at Bell Labs: the futures of communication, networks, robotics, and more. </p>

				<p>This cohortâ€™s work followed previous collaborations between NEW INC members and Bell Labs researchers from 2016-2019 and, of course, the legendary Experiments in Art & Technology program of many decades. This exhibition presents just one dynamic view into a rich and robust multi-year partnership between the New Museum and Nokia Bell Labs, and into the history of Experiments in Art & Technology.</p> 

				<p>This exhibition website was designed by Foreign Objects. </p>

				<p>The Experiments in Art & Technology program at Nokia Bell Labs is directed by Domhnaill Hernon, with production overseen by Ethan Edwards and Danielle McPhatter. </p>
